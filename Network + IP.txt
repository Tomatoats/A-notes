- Ethernet Payload
 - Each Packet has:
    -  Payload: Ethernet Header, IP, Protocol (TCP,UDP), Data (i.e VoiP or HTTP), Trailer
    - IP i.E Source IP 10.0.0.1 Dest IP = 10.0.0.2
    - Protocol i.E TCP Source Port = 3000 TCP Dest Port = 80
    - Data i.E Voip Data, HTTP Data
 - TCP and UDP are transported / Encapsulated IP Protocol
 - Is also at the OSI Layer 4, transport Layer
 - Multiplexing options if using TCP and UDP, able to use many applications at the same time
 - Payload: Ethernet Header, IP, Protocol (TCP,UDP), Data (i.e VoiP or HTTP), Trailer

- TCP: Transmission Control Protocol: 
 - Connection-oriented, has a formal connection to setup and close
 - It is considered Reliable delivery due to recover from errors and can manage Out-of-order messages
 - Flow Control, reciever can manage how much data is sent
 - Communication-Oriented protocols that prefer a 'return receipt' prefer TCP
 - these will be stuff like HTTPS or SSH
 - TCP Handles all communication overhead, so application doesn't worry about out of order frames or data


- UDP : User Datagram Protocol:
 - Connectionless, no formal open or close
 - Unreliable, no error recover or reordering of data
 - no flow control, sender can determine hhow much data is sent
 - UDP allows Real time communication - no way to stop and resend
 - DHCP and TFTP are connectionless protocols
 - thus, data might not get through , application keeps track and decides what to do 


IP: each packet goes from one IP to another
 - Port Numbers let packets know which Port it should arrive
 - IPv4 Sockets Need: Server IP Address, protocol, and server application port Numbers
 - and Client IP address, protocol, client port Numbers
 - Some Port numbers are permanent (non-ephememeral  i.e Port 80 goes for HTTPS, and typicially between 0-1023 )
 - Other Port Numbers are temporary (ephememeral i.e Port 1024-65535 are determined by client)
 - TCP and UDP can use any port
 - Most Servers use non-epheremeral (permanent) port numbers
 - Port Numbers are for communication, not security
 - Thus those service port numbers need to be well known
 - TCP port numbers aren't the same as UDP port number (in theory, there can be UDP and TCP both on port 80)
 


Port Numbers:
 - Having well known port numbers is good for firewall rules and how it works
 - FTP: File Transfer Protocol: Uses tcp/20 and tcp/21 (though usually needs authentication)
 - SSH: Secure Shell: uses tcp/22 - looks and act the same as telnet
 - Telnet : telecommunication network : uses tcp/23 (like SSH but unencrypted)
 - SMTP  : Simple Mail Transfer Protocol : tcp/25 : used to send mail to server ( pop3 & iMAPis used to recieve)
 - DNS: Domain Name System : udp/53 - very critical resource to convert URL's to IP addresses
 - DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol : udp/67, udp/68 - requires a DHCP Server - autoconfigs IP +more
   - these DHCP's are dymanic / pooled and IP addresses are assigned in real time, using leases
   - network Admins can make it so IP's can be reserved by MAC Addresses so they have the same IP
 - HTTP : Hypertext Transfer Protocol : communication for browser and other applications : tcp/80
 - HTTPS: same but secure / encrypted : tcp/443
 - POP3 - Post office Protocol version 3 : tcp/110 - mail transfer functionality
 - IMAP4 - internet Message Access Protocol v4 : tcp/143  - management of email inbox from multiple clients
 - SMB : Server Message Block - protocol used my windows (also CIFS) - for file sharing, printer sharing
   - uses NetBIOS over TCP/IP (network) Basic Input/Output System : udp/137 for netBios name service
   - and tcp/139 for netbios session service
   - Direct over tcp/445
 - SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol : gather stats from network devices
   - Queires: udp/161 , Traps : udp /162
   - v1 info is in the clear
   - v2 is inclear but bulk transfer
   - v3 finally had Encryption, authentication, and integrity
 - LDAP : Lightweight Directory Access Protocol : tcp/389
   - Stores and retrieves info in a network directory, commmonly used in microsoft active directory
 - RDP : Remote Desktop Protocol : tcp/3389 
   - remote desktop services on many windows versions , 
   - there's clients for any other applications /OS's  for Windows RDP




- Miscellaneous Terms:
    - DHCP : Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    - TFTP : Trivial File Transfer Protocol
    - HTTPS : Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
    - SSH : Secure Shell
