Laptops (Hardware):
 - Some Laptops are easier to fix than others

 - Batteries:
    - Some are able to be modular and easily replaced while others require a teardown
    - Usually use Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) and Lithium-Ion Polymer (Lipo)
    - No "Memory Effect" so you can charge it up to full without  losing charge
    - however charging it in general does diminish capacity
    - Different form factor for each Laptops
    - Battery Types and style can vary due to constantly changing 
    
 - Keyboard
    - The mose used component, can be easy to replace with a few screws and single ribbon cable
    - though it may not always be this simple
    - You can always connect an external keyboard as well
    - Keys:
    -  can repair or replace a keycap, is a delicate procedure
    -  Very easy to break caps or components underneath

 - Memory 
    - Uses Small Outline DUal in line Memory Module (So-DIMM)
    - also used in mobile device, often easy to install and replace
    - occasionally it's soldered to the system board, and if so there's no upgrade
    - you'd have to do a full  board replacement to upgrade 

 - Storage
    - Magnetic disks, aka spinning drive platters (HDD) usually in 2.5 inch FF
    - SSD, Solid state drive, all memory and no moving parts, 2.5 inch FF, less latency then HDD
    - M.2 , smaller form factor that doesn't use sata or power cables, easy to install and replace
    - Usually really easy to replace all of these parts, typically all internal
    - Open the cover or whole laptop, typically modular with a couple of screws
    - M.2's are even easier with only one screw and similar to a ram install
    - Migrating HDD to SSD is a huge jump , especally if you instal the OS on the SSD
    - though you may need specialized Hardware to clone the   drive
    - sometimes included with the SSD
    - You can either create the image file one drive at a time, or a drive-to-drive image

 - 802.11 wireless and bluetooth:
    - 802.11 Allows LAN Access to the internet, it's the standard. 
    - Bluetooth is a PAN that's short range, usually used for peripherals and other nearby devices                     
    - Typically connnects to the motherboard using either Mini PCI or Mini PCI Express

 - Biometrics
    - Some laptops have a way to sign in with fingerprint reader or face recognition
    - Requires additional config in the OS, and usually requires some type of Hardware
    - such as webcam, or fingerprint scanner. Relatively secure

 - NFC : Near Field Communiation
    - Usually 4 centimeters or less, used for data transfer and authentication
    - Common on mobile phones and smart watches
    - can use for authentication without putting in a password

 - WebCam : Video Capture
    - Built in Camera, sometimes mic, usually includes both auio and video drivers and software

 - Microphones :
    - Built in to the laptop display, Not good for casual use
    - Buy a USB  mic for better quality
   
Laptop / Mobile Displays:
 - When talking about Laptops, they usually have multiple antennas
 - Wifi, aux, bluetooth, and  more. 
 - the antennas  wires wraps around the laptop screen

 - Portable LCD: Liquid Crystal Displays
    - Light shines through liquid crystals. 
    - lightweight, relatively low power, and relatively inexpensive
    - Blacklight levels are a challenge, and it requires a seperarate Blacklight
    - the lights are difficult to replace, blackllights usually florescent, or LED

 - LCD Technologies
    - TN: Twisted Nematic LCD
       - Original LCD tech, it has fast response times but poor viewing angles and color shifts

    - IPS (In Plane Switchng) LCD
       - Excellent Color Representation, More Expensive to produce than TN
   
    - VA (Vertical Alignment) LCD
       - Good color Representation but slower response times than TN
       - Good  compromise between TN and IPS

 - OLED : Organic Light Emitting Diode
    - the Organic Compound emits light when receivin an electric current
    - It's thinner and lighter, flexible and mobile - No glass needed
    - No backlight, the Organic Compound Provides the Light
    - Very Accurate color representation but higher cost than LCD
    - Tablets, phones, Smartwatches, and more use OLED typically

 - Florescent vs LED  blackllights
    - CCFL : Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp
       - Higher Voltage  and power needed with an added thickness to the display
       - NO longer a common backlight, older laptops use this
   
    - LED backlit LCD display
       - Backlight is LEDs instead of florescent, LEDs around the edge of screen
       - An array of LEDs behind the screen, and latest laptops are LED backlit

    - LCD displays need a backlight, but need different powers to do so
    - Some laptops have inverters to turn DC into Access
    - to verify a backlight, look closely and use a flashlight. 
    - if {Redacted, come back}
    - May need to replace LCD inverter or display

Ways to access:

 - Digitizers: Pen like device as input using stylus, useful for graphical input
    - You usually need a display that supports it
    - Used commonly on laptop/tablets or hybrid devices

 - Touchscreen:
    - Merge laptop and tablet input, no keyboard required but often available
    - the digitzer responds to touch



- Miscelanneous Terms:
    - FF = Form factor
    - LAN = Local Area Network
    - PAN = Personal Area Network
