Connectors:
    - USB with Micro USB, USB B, USB Type A, B, C
    - USB is hardware but can input many signals such as displayport
    - Lightning for apple, can be put in either way
    - Before USB, DB-9 (DE-9) was used that uses RS-232 signals
    - those DB-9 are still used for older switches or routers
    - NFC - NEar field communication
    - used for access token, identity card, payment
    - Bluetooth is known, as well as hotspot
    
Peripherals: 

     - Touch Pen / capacitive stylus : activate interface without actually touching the device with fingers
         - Good for handwriting and signatures

     - Active Stylus / Digital Stylus : a More precise stylus compared to the pen, usually for artistry
         - stylus communicates directly to the device, and must be compatible with the tablet

     - Drawing Pad : uses an active stylus with an external Digitizers
         - Third party Device typically

     - Trackpad : replaces the mouse, usually on laptops, though there is an external trackpad that is battery powered
         - Can enable and disable trackpad

     - Handsets : whether Wireless or wired (through a 3.5 mm jack called TRRS (Tip ring ring sleeve))

     - Speakers : Typically battery powered and bluetooth, with better speakers than your phones

     - Docking Station : Put laptop into it and your external devices connect to docking stations

     - Port Replicator : Like a Docking Station but you connect laptop via USB C (think work )

Cellular Networks:
     - Called that because  they seperate land into ~hexagonal cells
     - Antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies

     - First Were called 2G Networks
         - Split into GSM : GLobal System for Mobile Communications
             - 90% of the Market, originally EU Standard but had worldwide coverages
             - Used by AT&T and T-Mobile in the US, could move SIM card (subscriber Identity Module) from phone to phone
             - Used Multiplexing, everyone got a little slice of time
         - and CDMA: Code Division Multiple Access
             - Could have everyone communicate at the same time, but each call uses a different Code
             - code are used to filter each call ont he receiving specialized
             - used by Verizon and Sprint, handsets are controlled by the network provider but wasn't mass adopted
        - Poor data support, circuit switching

     - 3G Network - in 1998
         - Upgraded Data connectivity over 2g, several mbps (megabit/second)
         - Bandwith improvement allowed GPS, Mobile TV, video on demand, and more data usage

     - 4G (LTE) : Long Term Evolution
         - Coverged the GSM and CDMA Providers
         - Based on GSM and EDGE (Enhanced data rates for GSM Evolution)
         - supports download up to 150 Mbit/s
        
         - LTE-A (LTE Advanced) Can go up to 300 Mbit/s
     
     - 5G - made in 2020
         - At hgiher frequencies we can hit 10 Gbit/s
         - though typically slow speeds at 100-900 Mbit/s 
         - Significant IoT impact, bandwith became less of  constraint
         - Alows for larger data transfer and monitoring / notifications

     - PRL (Preferred Roaming List)
         - Used in CDMA NEtworks (Verizon, Sprint)
         - Allows your phone to connect to the right tower, can be updated over the air (OTA)

gps : Global Positioning System
     - Created by the U.S Department of Defense, Over 30 satellites currently in orbit
     - Precise Navigation, calculates via at least 4 satellites
     - Determines locations based on timing differences (longitude, latitude, altitude)
     - Mobile Device location services use geotracking (for maps, directions)
     - can determine physical location based on GPS, Wifi, and cellular towers



- Mobile Configurations:
     - iCloud
     - Can choose to customize and synchronize
     - Can Synchronize multiple Data types (i.e mail, pictures, contacts)
     - There's data caps and transfer Costs

     - MDM - Mobile Device Management
         - Allows to manage both company owned and user owned devices, using BYOD - bring your own device
         - think MobileIron, allows centralized managment of the mobile devices with specialized functionality
         - You can set policies on apps, data, camera, etc. can either control the whole device or only a partition
         - Manage Access controls to force screen locks and PIN's 
         - Corporate email configurations can be pushed by the MDM
         - also can add two-factor authentication 
         - can also restrict or allow certain apps to prevent unauthorized app usage
    
     - Can Synchronize Cloud Services
     - Can send, recieve, and manage email, notes, calendars, and more via these cloud services
     - though there are configurations for data / transfers costs
