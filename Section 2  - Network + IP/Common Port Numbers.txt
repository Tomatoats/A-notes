Port Numbers:
 - Having well known port numbers is good for firewall rules and how it works
 - FTP: File Transfer Protocol: Uses tcp/20 and tcp/21 (though usually needs authentication)
 - SSH: Secure Shell: uses tcp/22 - looks and act the same as telnet
 - Telnet : telecommunication network : uses tcp/23 (like SSH but unencrypted)
 - SMTP  : Simple Mail Transfer Protocol : tcp/25 : used to send mail to server ( pop3 & iMAPis used to recieve)
 - DNS: Domain Name System : udp/53 - very critical resource to convert URL's to IP addresses

 - DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol : udp/67, udp/68 - requires a DHCP Server - autoconfigs IP +more
   - these DHCP's are dymanic / pooled and IP addresses are assigned in real time, using leases
   - network Admins can make it so IP's can be reserved by MAC Addresses so they have the same IP
 - HTTP : Hypertext Transfer Protocol : communication for browser and other applications : tcp/80
 - HTTPS: same but secure / encrypted : tcp/443
 - POP3 - Post office Protocol version 3 : tcp/110 - mail transfer functionality
 - IMAP4 - internet Message Access Protocol v4 : tcp/143  - management of email inbox from multiple clients

 - SMB : Server Message Block - protocol used my windows (also CIFS) - for file sharing, printer sharing
   - uses NetBIOS over TCP/IP (network) Basic Input/Output System : udp/137 for netBios name service
   - and tcp/139 for netbios session service
   - Direct over tcp/445

 - SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol : gather stats from network devices
   - Queires: udp/161 , Traps : udp /162
   - v1 info is in the clear
   - v2 is inclear but bulk transfer
   - v3 finally had Encryption, authentication, and integrity

 - LDAP : Lightweight Directory Access Protocol : tcp/389
   - Stores and retrieves info in a network directory, commmonly used in microsoft active directory

 - RDP : Remote Desktop Protocol : tcp/3389 
   - remote desktop services on many windows versions , 
   - there's clients for any other applications /OS's  for Windows RDP
