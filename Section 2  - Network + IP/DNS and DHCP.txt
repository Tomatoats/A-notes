DNS: Domain Name systems
     - Translate the urls we know to IP Addresses
     - Many DNS servers, 13 root server Clusters and  over 1000 actual servers
     - hundreds of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) - .com, .org, .net, etc
     - Over 275 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) - .us, .uk, .ca, etc

     - hierarchy: 
         - first: the humble . (to let you know the domain name is done)
         - then first tier TLD will be .com, .net, .edu, .org
         - specialized Domains like the website name (github) or .professormesser would be on the next tier down
         - then www would be the tier below that, as well as stuff like mail or live instead of www
    
     - Could use dig or nslookup command and then url i.e dig alexys.online and you can see iP addresses
     - DNS has a lot of Resource Records (RR)  to hold domain name Services
     - Over 30 Record types , i.e IP ddresses, certificates, host alias names, etc
     - Very important and critical configs, make sure to check settings, backup, and testing
     - DNS Configs usually a text file or plain text that show names, certs, aliases, and IP'same
     - might also have a web based config

     - Resource Records:
        
         - Adress Records: (A) or (AAAA)
             - Defines the IP Address od a host, and most popular query
             - A records are for IPv4 addresses, and AAAA records are for IPv6 addresses
             - Modify the records to change the host name or IP Address resolution
        
         - Mail Exchaner Record (MX)
             - Determines the host name for the mail server, which isn't an IP Address, but a name
             - to obtain the IP, check the A 

         - Text Record (TXT)
             - Human readable text information 
             - Useful public info that was originally designed for informal info
             - Can be used for verifcation purposes
             - if you have access to the DNS, you must be admin of the domain
             - Commonly used for email security, since external email servers validate info from your DNS
             - can see some of these records using dig <url> TXT or nslookup -type=txt <url> 

         - Sender Policy Framework  (SPF) :
             - SPF Protocol : A list of all servers authorized to send emails to the domain, helps prevent mail spoofing
             - Mail servers perform a check to see if incoming mail really did come from an authorized host
        
         - Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) : 
             - Digitally sign a domain's outgoing mail
             - The Public key is in the DKIM TXT record
         
         - DMARC : Domain-based message Authentication, Reporting, and Confermance
             - Prevent Unauthorized email use (spoof) , an extension of SPF and DKIM
             - Can decide what external email servers should do with emails that don't validate through SPF or DKIM
             - Policy is written to a DMARC TXT record
             - Accept all, send spam, reject email
             - Compliance reports to be sent to email admin

DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
     - Scope Properties : IP Address range, subnet masks, lease durations, DNS Server, gateway, and VoiP
     - DHCP Pools Groups of IP adresses, and each subnet has its own scope like 192.168.1.0/24
     - A scope is generally a single continguous pool of IP addresses, but DHCP Exceptions can be made inside of the scope
     - DHCP has a big pool of addresses to lease for x amount of time, and then are reclaimed
     - Many DHCP assign automatically, and DHCP server keeps a list of past assignments so you can get the same IP address if you were on recently
     - can always reserve an address, which has to be done with admin countrols, and uses MAC address
     - might be called static dhcp assignment, static dhcp, static assignment, or ip reservation 
     - DHCP Leases are temporary, could allocate or reallocate via rebooting computer
     - can also manually release an IP Address
     - T1 Timer checks halfway through the Lending DHCP server to tell DHCP server you still want your IP
     - T2 timer , if original DHCP server is down, it tries to rebind to another DHCP server, and at 7/8ths of the lease time
     

VLAN : Virtual LAN
     - Local Areal Networks : a group of devices in the same broadcast domain
     - Vlan  Allows us to seperate interfaces to different networks without having to buy a new switch
     
VPN : Virtual Private network
     - Encrypted (private) data traversing a public network
     - Connects to A concentrator, Encryption/decryption access device often integrated into a firewall
     - Many deployment options , from specialized cryptographic hardware or software
     - Used with client software but sometimes built into the OS
     - Can use client to site VPN for on demand access from a remote device using software
     - with that software connecting to a vpn concentrator
     - and some software can be configured to always be on

Miscellaneous :
     - TTL : Time to Live , how long the info for a record to stay in cache in the DNS
