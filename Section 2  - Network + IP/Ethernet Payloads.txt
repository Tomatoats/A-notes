Ethernet Payload
 - Each Packet has:
    -  Payload: Ethernet Header, IP, Protocol (TCP,UDP), Data (i.e VoiP or HTTP), Trailer
    - IP i.E Source IP 10.0.0.1 Dest IP = 10.0.0.2
    - Protocol i.E TCP Source Port = 3000 TCP Dest Port = 80
    - Data i.E Voip Data, HTTP Data
 - TCP and UDP are transported / Encapsulated IP Protocol
 - Is also at the OSI Layer 4, transport Layer
 - Multiplexing options if using TCP and UDP, able to use many applications at the same time
 - Payload: Ethernet Header, IP, Protocol (TCP,UDP), Data (i.e VoiP or HTTP), Trailer

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol: 
 - Connection-oriented, has a formal connection to setup and close
 - It is considered Reliable delivery due to recover from errors and can manage Out-of-order messages
 - Flow Control, reciever can manage how much data is sent
 - Communication-Oriented protocols that prefer a 'return receipt' prefer TCP
 - these will be stuff like HTTPS or SSH
 - TCP Handles all communication overhead, so application doesn't worry about out of order frames or data


UDP : User Datagram Protocol:
 - Connectionless, no formal open or close
 - Unreliable, no error recover or reordering of data
 - no flow control, sender can determine hhow much data is sent
 - UDP allows Real time communication - no way to stop and resend
 - DHCP and TFTP are connectionless protocols
 - thus, data might not get through , application keeps track and decides what to do 


IP: each packet goes from one IP to another
 - Port Numbers let packets know which Port it should arrive
 - IPv4 Sockets Need: Server IP Address, protocol, and server application port Numbers
 - and Client IP address, protocol, client port Numbers
 - Some Port numbers are permanent (non-ephememeral  i.e Port 80 goes for HTTPS, and typicially between 0-1023 )
 - Other Port Numbers are temporary (ephememeral i.e Port 1024-65535 are determined by client)
 - TCP and UDP can use any port
 - Most Servers use non-epheremeral (permanent) port numbers
 - Port Numbers are for communication, not security
 - Thus those service port numbers need to be well known
 - TCP port numbers aren't the same as UDP port number (in theory, there can be UDP and TCP both on port 80)
 

- Miscellaneous Terms:
    - DHCP : Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    - TFTP : Trivial File Transfer Protocol
    - HTTPS : Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
    - SSH : Secure Shell
    - SNMP : Simple Network Management Protocol
    - NAT : Network Address translation - a method to map IP addresses to conserve global address space
