Sattelite Networking:
     - Non terrestrial communication with high cost compared to terrestrial
     - 50 mbit/s down, 3 mbit/s up are common.
     - usually used for remote, difficult to network sites
     - high latency, around 250 ms up and down
     - though starlink advertises 40 ms and working toward 20 ms
     - high frequencies, of 2 ghz, operate over line of sight, so rain can mess it up (rain fade)

Fiber:
     - High speed data communication that uses frequencies of light
     - higher installation cost than copper , more difficult to repair
     - but can communicate over long distances
     - large installation in the WAN core, supports very  high data rates
     - uses SONET , wavelength division multiplexing
     - Fiber is slowly being widely adopted for both business and home use

Cable Broadband:
     - Transmission accross multiple frequencies using COAX Cable
     - different traffic types using data on the Cable network
     - DOCSIS : Data over Cable Service Interfcace Specification
     - High speeds, from 50 Mbit/s through 1000+Mbit/s 
     
DSL: Digital Subscriber line:"
     - Uses the Telephone line
     - Usually ADSL (Asymmetric) because download speed is faster than the upload speed
     - 200 Mbit/s downstream , 20 Mbit/s upstream
     - ~10,000 ft limitation from the central office (CO), faster speeds closer to CO

Cellular Network:
     - Can use our phone as a internet connection by Tethering or mobile hotspot

WISP : Wireless Internet Service Provider:
     - Terrestrial internet access using wireless
     - Connect rural or remote locations
     - may use meshed 802.11, 5G home internet, or propiarty wireless
     - speeds can range from 10 to 1000 mbit/s
    
LAN : Local Area Network
     - While Local is relative (building or group of buildings), they provide high speed connectivitiy
     - typically uses ethernet and 802.11 wireless. Any slower and it isn't 'local' 

WAN : Wide Area Network
     - Spanning the Globe, generally connects LAN accross a distance, and thus much slower
     - Many different WAN Techs from point-to-point serial, MPLS, etc, and can be terrestrial or no terrestrial
     - MPLS : Multiprotocol Label switching, a routing technique to firect data from one node to the next using labels


PAN: Personal Area Network
     - Your own private network, with stuff like bluetooth, IR, NFC
     - used in automobiles for audio output , integrated with phones. 
     - used in health, wireless headsets, etc etc

MAN : Metropolitan Area Network
     - A network in your city that's larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN
     - Historically MAN-specific topologies, but Metro Ethernet is the most common
     - Common to see government ownership as they 'own' the right-of-way

SAN : Storage Area Network
     - Looks and feels like a local storage device with Block-level access (very efficient to read and write)
     - Requires a lot of bandwith, may use an isolated network and high speed topology

WLAN : Wireless LAN
     - think 802.11 (wifi) Techs
     - has good Mobility within buildings or geographical areas
     - You can expand coverage with additional access points for a large campus for example
