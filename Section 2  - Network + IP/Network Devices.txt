Network Devices: 
 - Routers: Route's traffic between IP Subnets, and makes forwarding decision based on IP
   - Some switches have routers in them, sometimes called a layer 3 switch (routers are layer 3)
   - Connects different network types such as LAN, WAN, copper, fiber

 - Switches : forwards traffic based on data link address (MAC)
   - Many Ports and Featgyres , some have Power over Ethernet
   - The Bridging is done in hardware using Application-specific integrated circuit
   - Multilayer switches are those with routing functionality
   - Unmanaged switches are plug and play, fixed configuration so no VLAN
   - also no manangement protocols (i.e SNMP)
   - Managed switches (think the Aruba) - have VLAN support and traffic prioritization
   - To have Redundancy support, they use Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
   - Also has port mirroring (to capture packets) and External Management (SNMP)

 - Access Point: A bridge that extends the wired network onto the wireless network
   - makes forwarding decisions based on MAC Address (just like a switch)

 - Firewalls; Filters traffic by port number (OSI Layer 4 (TCP/UDP))
   - Can encrypt traffic into / out of the network to protect traffic between switches
   - can proxy traffic, and most firewalls  can be routers / layer 3 devices
   - if they can filter traffic based on application, they're also a layer 7 firewall

 - Power Over Ethernet (PoE): Power provided on an Ethernet Cable
   - Useful for cameras, wireless access points, and other IoT devices
   - The Power can either be provided by the switch (EndSpans) or in line power injector (midspan)
   - the PoE switches will be commonly marked
   - Three Specifications:
      - PoE : IEEE 802.3af-2003
        - Original PoE Specification, rolled into 802.3 standard
        - 15.4 watts DC power, 350 mA max current
    
      - PoE+ : IEE 802.3at-2009
        - Now also part of the 802.3 standard
        - 25.5 watts DC Power, 600 mA max current

      - PoE++ : IEEE 802.3bt-2018
        - Type 3: 51 Watts DC Power, 600 mA max current
        - Type 4: 71.3 Watts, 960 mA max current
        - PoE with 10GBASE-T (10 gigabit per second)

 - Hub : Multi-port repeater
   - Old, typoically we use switches now , as hubs repeat traffic from one port to all Ports
   - everything is half duplex, and becomes less efficient as network traffic increases
   - 10 megabit / 100 megabit connections, difficult to find today

 - Different Modems: 
  - Cable Modem : Uses Broadband, transmission across multiple frequencies on a single wired
    - Uses that Coax cable, data on cable network = DOCSIS (data over cable service interface specification)
    - Can go up to 1 gigabit/s, and can do multiple services such as data, voice, video

  - DSL Modem : ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) - uses telephone lines
    - Download speed is faster than upload speed (Asymmetric)
    - 10,000 foot limitation from the central office (CO), faster speeds may be possible if closer to CO
    - 52 Mbit/s downstream / 16 Mbit/s upstream are commonly

  - ONT : Optical network terminal (Fiber) 
    - Connects the ISP Fiber network to the copper Ethernet network 
    - There's a Demarcation point (demarc) on the outside where fiber connects to turn into copper
    - terminal box on the side of the building to do that. one side of box you're responsible for (the copper)
    - and the other side , the fiber side, the ISP is respoinsible for

 - Network Interface Card (NIC) : every device on the network has a NIC
   - used on anything from Computers to routers.
   - There's specific ones for each network type like ethernet, wan, wireless, etc
   - Often built in to the motherboard or added as an expansion card




Cable Infrastruture: Usually a ethernet into a patch run (patch run permamnent)
 - the patch cable goes to patch panel, which then has an rj45 (ethernet) connector Header
 - then that ethernet goes to a switch, that way people in an office can be connected without complication

Software Defined Networking:
 - Networking Devices have different functional planes of operation
 - these change physical things like switches and split to logical units we can create in the cloud
    
    - Infrastrure Layer / Data Plane 
      - Process the network frame and packets, takes care of forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT
      - Network Traffic happens through this layer

    - Control Layer / Control Plane
      - Manages actions of the data plane, i.e routing tables, session tables, NAT tables. 
      - Dynamic Routing protocol updates through this layer

    - Application Layer / Management Plane
      - Allows us to Configure and manage the Device, typically through SSH, Browser, or API's
      
  - Allows Us to manage and turn these systems online into the cloud
