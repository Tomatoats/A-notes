Network Services : Servers and other things we might find in a network rack needed to make things works
 
  - DNS Server
    - Domain Name System: Converts names to IP Addresses and Vice Versa
    - Distributed Naming System : load is balanced across different Servers
    - Usually managed byt he ISp or enterprise IT Department, it's a critical resource

  - DHCP : Dynamic Host Configuration protocol
    - Automatic IP adress Configuration
    - very common service, available on most home routers
    - Enterprise DHCP will be redundant, usually running on central Servers
  
  - File Server
    - Centrralized storage of files, a fileshare.
    - uses protocols such as SMB (Server message Block) or AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) to manage files
    - Front end hides the  protocol
  
  - Print Server
    - Connects a printer to the network so that the printer can provide service to all network devices
    - May be software in a computer, so everyone sends to the computer and then computer sends to printer
    - may be built in to the printer using network adapters and software
    - Uses Standard Printing protocols: SMB , IPP (Internet Printing Protocol), LPD (Line Printer Daemon)

  - Mail Servser
    - Store incoming and sends outgoign mail
    - Usually managed by the ISP or enterprise IT department, with a complex set of requirements
    - because it's one of trhe most important services, usually 24x7 support in case it goes awry
  
  - Syslog:
    - allows us to consolidate all the logs from these other servers
    - Usually intergrated into a SIEM
    - needs a large large file space

  - Web Server:
    - Responds to browser requests using standard web browsing protocols like Http, https
    - Web pages are stored on the server and then downloaded to the browser
    - could dynamically build the page then send to a browser, or send the static

  - Authentication server
    - Centralizes management : login 
    - Not required on a home network 
    - Usually a very critical resource so there's many servers for redundancy
    
  - Spam gateway
    - Can send spam to the gateway before it hits the actual internalized mail server
    - On site or cloud based

  - Next Gen  Firewall
    - sometimes called Unified Threat Management (UTM) or Web security Gateway
    - Can have URL Filter / content inspection
    - Malware inspection, spam filter
    - CSU / DSU Capabilites (allow you to connect to WAN's)
    - Can be router, switch, firewall, bandwidth shaper
    - also intrusion detection systems (IDS) or Intrustion Prevention systems
    - Can also be used a VPN Endpoint

  - Load Balancers
    - Distribute the load between multiple servers without the end user knowing
    - Fault Tolerant , server outages have no efficient
    - Can Configure load and has TCP Offload
    - Can also have SSL Offload
    - also can cach for fast response
    - Can do Prioritzation for QOS
    - as well as content switching

  - Proxy Servers
    - an intermediate server
    - client makes a request to proxy, proxy performs request, then proxy provides result to client
    - can filter URL, scan content, cache, and perform access control
    
  - SCADA / ICS: Supervisory Control and Data Aquition System
    - Large-scale multisite Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
    - PC Manages Equipment of large scale faculties (Power Generation, refinery, manufacturing) 
    - Takes care of facilites, industrial, energy, and logistics
    - Scada helps us distrubte control systems in real time
    - Requires Extensive segmentation from the network and no access from the outside
    
  - Legacy and Embedded Systems
    - another expression for really old, but could be really important
    - Embedded systems : Purpose-built device
    - these embedded systems for an alarm system, door security, or time card system might no have a way to access OS
    
  - Iot (Internet of Things)
    - Appliances connect to wireless networks
    - such as refrigerators, smart decvies, air control with thermostats, smart doorbells, etc
    - may be on a seperate network to limit security breaches
