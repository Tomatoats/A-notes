Cable Crimpers:
     - Pinch the connector onto a wire,
     - used for coaxial, twisterd pair, Fiber
     - Final Step of the process, connecting the modular connector to an ethernet Cable
     - Metal prongs are pushed through the installation 
     - the plug is also permanently pressed onto the cable sheath 
     - Get a good crimper and a good pair of elctricians scissors / cable snips, and a good wire stripepr
     - Make sure you use the correct modular connectos, differences between wire types

WiFI Analyzer: 
     - Wireless networks are incredibly easy to monitor since everyone 'hears' everything
     - could be software or purpose-built hardware or mobile device add-on
     - specializess in 802.11 analysis and idify errors and interference
     - validate antenna location and installation

Tone Generator / Toner Probe
     - Toner Probe allows you to follow a wire by putting an analog sound
     - Can use to trace a wire, even in complex environments
     - Connect the one enerator to the wire, using modular jack, coax, or punch down connectors
     - then use a probe to locate the sound, two-tone sound is easy to find

Punch down tool :
     - Punch a wire into a wiring block, could be 66 block, 110 block, or others
     - Can be tedious for every wire must be individually punched
     - Trims the wires during the punch, so it's a very efficient process
     - Organization is key, as there's lots of wires
     - Maintain the twist, your cat 6a cable will thank you later
     - Document everything, whether by written documentation, tags, or graffiti

Cable Testers :
     - Relatively simple, using a contninuity test, and a simple wire Metropolitan
     - can identify missing pins or crossed wires
     - not usually used for frequency testing, thus no crosstalk, signal loss, etc capabilities
     
Loopback Plugs:     
     - Useful for testing physical ports, or fooling applications. 
     - typically used for Ethernet, T1, fiber, and they AREN"T CROSSOVER cables 
     - used to send info from a port back to itself, using either Serial or RS-232 (9 pin or 25 pin)

Taps and port mirrors:
     - Intercept network traffic and send a copy to a packet capture device
     - Physical taps can disconnect the link, and put a tap in the middle, and can be active or passive
     - Port mirrors can redirect ports, usually into a SPAN (Switched port Analyzer)
     - it's a software-based tap with limited functionality but can work well in a pinch
