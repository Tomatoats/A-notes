Wireless Standards (Wi-Fi):
  - Wireless Networking uses 802.11 standards, managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802)
  - There's been many updates over time , check IEEE for the latest, but a brief history
  - Wi-Fi has been trademarked, and the Wi-fi Alliance handles interoperability testing
  - Wi-fi usually calls the new standard a new name (such as wi-fi 7), so you don't have to remember the letter
  

  - 802.11a
    - October 1999, one of the original wireleess standards
    - Operates in 5 GHz range, or other frequencies with special licensing
    - 54 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
    - Smaller range than 802.11b, cause the higher frequency is absorbed by objects in the way
  
  - 802.11b
    - October 1999, the other original 802.11 standard
    - Operates at 2.4 Ghz range
    - 11 Mbit/s 
    - Better range than 802.11a due to less absorption problem
    - 2.4 ghz have more frequency conflicts because bluetooth, microwave ovens, cordless phones, etc use 2.4

  - 802.11g
    - June 2003
    - 2.4 Ghz
    - 54 Mbit/s 
    - Backwards compatible with 802.11b

  - 802.11n (Wifi 4)
    - October 2009
    - Operates at both 5 ghz and 2.4 ghz
    - 40 Mhz Channel widths (more bandwidth)
    - Could go up 600 Mbit/s (with 40 Mhz Mode and 4 antennnas)
    - uses MIMO (Multiple input- multiple output) : could have multple transmit and receive antennnas

  - 802.11ac (Wifi 5)
    - January 2014
    - 5ghz
    - up to 160 Mhz (more bandwidth), increased channel bonding
    - denser Signaling Modulation (faster data transfers)
    - Eight MU-MIMO Downlink streams (twice as many as Wifi-4) (Multi user MIMO)
    - Up to 7Gbit/s

  - 802.11ax (wifi 6)
    - February 2021
    - 5ghz and/or 2 ghz
    - 1.2 ghz/s/c (per second per channel), theorhetically up to 9.6 Ghz if you use every channel at once
    - eight bi directional MU-MIMO streams
    - Orthogonal Frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) - Improves High Density installations
    - Works similar to cellular communication

  -            Frequencies        Max MIMO Streams     Output/stream  Total Output

  - Wireless access points have a range of 40-50 meters
  - To connect two buildings located miles from each other, use fixed directional attennas
  - Keep them outdoors to minimize signal absorption or bounce, and increase signal strength
  - Wireless regulations are complex so refer to your country's regulatory policy
  - check other frequencies, additional frequencies and licensing may be required
  - Signal strength are dependant and regulated for indoor / outdoor use
  - Outdoor antenna installation is dificult, so it usually is installed and set up by experts

  - RFID: Radio-frequency identification
    - It's everywhere : access badges, inventory/assembling line tracking
    - pet/animal identification, or anything to be tracked
    - if cylindrical, around the same size as grain of rice: if flat, typically smaller than a key from a keyboard
    - Uses Same technology as radar: Radioenergy is transmitted to the tag, 
    - radio frequencies power the tag, and the ID is transmitted Backwards
    - bidirectional communication
    - Some tag formats can be active / powered 

  - NFC: Near field communication
    - Two way wireless communication, built on RFID which is mostly one-way
    - Used in payment systems (think apple pay, or tapping card)
    - NFC can also help with bluetooth pairing, bootstrapped on
    - Can also be used as an access token or identity card similar to access badge
    - this is because it's short range with encryption support

  - Channels: the IEEE Named channels for different groups of frequencies
    - Non overlapping channels would be ideal
    - 2.4 Ghz use IEEE Channel 1,6,11 at 20Mhz from 2412 Mhz through 2482Mhz
    - There are plenty other Channels for 5 Ghz
    - Bluetooth uses 2.4 Ghz Ranged that uses Unliscened ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical)
    - Bluetooth can go up to 10 Meters, but there are industrial bluetooth that go up to 100 meters
